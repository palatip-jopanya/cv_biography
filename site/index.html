          <p class="paragraph1">I am Palatip Jopanya. My nickname is John which originally came from "ç´„ç¿°:John" in Chinese and pronounce "Yorn" in Thai. I was born in Chiang Mai province located in North region of Thailand. My family are Christian. I was born as younger brother to one sister. My parents and grandparents are Chinese migrants where they find difficulty to make a living in Myanmar and finally ended up in Thailand before few years I was born. In my young age I love adventures, swimming, hiking, fishing, and playing with friends just like the others kid. In the meantime, I find myself enjoy playing remote control car where I disassemble all part and reassemble for fun. Starting the high school, I changed focus to my study less time for playing and more serious on studying like the others Asian kids were pressure from they parents. By hard work and God grace I was accepted to the Cityâ€™s University major in Electrical Engineering. While study Engineering I find fasinating in the computer technology filed. One thing that I would never forget during the study is the project that I have done under my favorite instructorâ€™s advisory the project focus on Digital image processing application on android. After graduate I decided to start work in the telecommunication company as it is the only match my preferences with limited opportunities in Thailand. Time files (fast) in the working life. In my working timeline has been pass through the wireless telecommunication evolution from 3G to 4G and to 5G. One of the most important thing I have learn from the work is that the firm fundamental is important to learn new technoloty or solve the problems or deploy the appication in any work and I am glad that I have been working hard on building fundamental so that I can have clear view on the technical domain. I wish in the future the world will be better for living places by the help of technology and I am thrilled for the coming future technology. Thank you very much for reading my Biography ðŸ˜Š</p>
