          <h5 class="name"> Biography</h5>
          <p class="paragraph1">I am Palatip Jopanya. My nickname is John which originally came from "ç´„ç¿°:John" in Chinese and pronounce "Yorn" in Thai. I was born in Chiang Mai province located in the North region of Thailand. My family is Christian. I was born as a younger brother to one sister. My parents and grandparents are Chinese migrants where who find it difficult to make a living in Myanmar and finally ended up in Thailand before the few years I was born. At my young age I love adventures, swimming, hiking, fishing, and playing with friends just like the others kid. In the meantime, I find myself enjoy playing remote control cars where I disassemble all parts and reassemble for fun. Starting high school, I changed my focus to my study less time for playing and more serious on studying like the other Asian kids who were pressured by their parents. By hard work and God's grace, I was accepted to the Cityâ€™s University major in Electrical Engineering. While study Engineering I find fascinating in the computer technology field. One thing that I would never forget during the study is the project that I have done under my favorite instructorâ€™s advisory the project focus on Digital image processing application on android. After the graduate, I decided to start work in a telecommunication company as it is the only match my preferences with limited opportunities in Thailand. Time files (fast) in the working life. My working timeline has been pass through the wireless telecommunication evolution from 3G to 4G and 5G. One of the most important things I have learned from the work is that the firm fundamental is important to learn new technology or solve problems or deploy the application in any work and I am glad that I have been working hard on building fundamentals so that I can have a clear view on the technical domain. I wish in the future the world will be better for living places with the help of technology and I am thrilled for the coming future technology. Thank you very much for reading my Biography ðŸ˜Š</p>
